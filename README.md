# hello-world
my first github repository

I am Amadeus Amling. As of yet, I am 25 years old and now studiying Applied Media and Communication Science at the the TU Ilmenau. In the seminar called Praxiswerkstatt ("practical workshop" literally translated) GitHub is an essential tool for the management of the project, a video game, which is to be developed over the course of said seminar.
